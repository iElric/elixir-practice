Still feel struggling, need more experience on it.

7. Which parts of this assignment did you have trouble with, if any?
Both the elixir part and deploy part. I have never learned an a functional

deployment is quit hard because we didn't really know phoenix and I
think professor should talk more about it in lectures.
